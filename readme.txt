Task:
Write a simple program and upload the code to github and share the location.

Parameters:
Spend less than one hour, in any language, create a program that does the following:
One form one label
two buttons
 -one closes
 -one updates the label with the current time.

 After overthinking the task, I went with visual basic because I was afraid html and javascript 
 was more than one language and might be considered outside of the given parameters.
 Though the design of the form and buttons took 10-15 minutes at most, I spent 2-3 hours
 downloading, installing, and setting up my visual basic environment, because I have not attempted
 to use visual studio and visual basic in approximately 15 years.
